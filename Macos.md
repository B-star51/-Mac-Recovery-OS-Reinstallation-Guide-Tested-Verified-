# -Mac-Recovery-OS-Reinstallation-Guide-Tested-Verified-
This process was used to recover and reinstall macOS on a Late 2015 iMac stuck in a boot loop with no working GUI and no  functioning internet recovery. Took a couple of hours, and included several failed attempts before success.


Overview:

Symptoms: Black screen, question mark folder, no macOS GUI.

Diagnosis: Corrupted system, internet recovery failed, no bootable system. 


Initially I went to apple forums online to see on any potential areas that can help me. I read in many area's try internet recovery on mac. Soi thats exaclty what i did. cmd + r on a mac keyboard and alt r on a windows keyboard gets you to internet recovery on a mac. 

I imediately went to disk utility and earased the disks and partioned them correctly. 

Went to install macOS and it failed tried a bunch of times that day kept on getting the error "AN error occured while preparing the installation. Try running this application agaain"-- as many times as i retried this installation it conituend failing--   after that i read on a forum sometiomes these errors occur beacuse of the date --so in internet recovery i went tot terminal looked at the date by tyuping "date" and it was correct next step what reviewing the  installation logs found a log something like " could not find startup disk" so i went back to reading and tryoing to find a solution --and that was create a bootable USB installer using the full createinstallmedia. 

 Key Notes & Common Issues
1. Always Use Official Apple Installers
Use the official Apple support site to download macOS disk images:

Apple macOS download links--- https://support.apple.com/en-in/102662 and https://support.apple.com/en-in/101578


Do not rely on Internet Archive versions. They often cause mounting or verification issues


 2. Partitioning & Volume Mount Errors
One major recurring issue was the error:
"Mount path is not valid" during createinstallmedia.

To check if your USB is mounted correctly:

ls /Volumes
If your USB appears there, it’s mounted — but make sure:

It is formatted as Mac OS Extended (Journaled).  - Very important!

The GUID Partition Map scheme is used.


3. Use the Full createinstallmedia Command -- Terminal 
The shortened version often fails or gives permission/path errors.

Use this full format command (example for El Capitan):

sudo /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia \
--volume /Volumes/MyVolume \
--applicationpath /Applications/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan.app \
--nointeraction --verbose 

 OR --verbose is highly recommended — it makes the installer "talk back" and show you real-time errors or progress.


4. Installer Gets Stuck or Reboots to Wrong OS
First Attempt Failed due to installing a version lower than the factory OS (Mavericks).

Always verify the original OS your Mac shipped with — using a version below this can block installation.

Afterward, macOS Sierra only worked from USB:

Without USB = no OS

With USB = Sierra booted live

Could not install until the disk was fully prepared and accepted the image.

Eventually, a bootable USB was created for Monterey from Sierra using the official Apple links — 
this was used to successfully upgrade the system.


5. Installer Freeze ("Less than a minute remaining")
Known Monterey bug.

Solution: Power off and power on once.

Installation will often resume or restart successfully on the next boot. -- 
3 failed attemts later throughout the night --Monterey was installed!

6. Disk Errors in Logs
When reviewing logs during failed boots or installs, disk-related errors like:

"Could not mount disk"

"No valid target"

Typically caused by:

Incorrect partition scheme

Damaged or improperly formatted volumes

Fixed via Disk Utility or full disk erase/repartitioning.


Future Recommendations:
Always keep a bootable macOS USB ready
